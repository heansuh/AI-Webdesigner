# How to run
* The Jupyter Notebook `genai.ipynb` was run on Jupyter Lab provided by the course coordinator, and the logs are found in the notebook.
* All the packages and dependencies are found in this file: `requirements.txt`.
* The code in the notebook shows how the dataset is sampled as well.

# Output
* The final output files are `product-placeholder.png`, `logo-placeholder.png` and `company_page.html`.
* `company_website.html` and `dynamic_company_website.html` were intermediate results which were to show that the generative AI model was not working as expected.
